# Preparation

* Segment cells with BacStalk (Matlab, v1.8, https://drescherlab.org/data/bacstalk/docs/index.html)
* you can use Split_Image to prepare images (see static_localization)
* generate a demograph and save as tiff
  * Alignment: Cell pole
  * Measurement: Your fluorescent channel name
  * Type: Mean
  * Orientate cells: Intensity maxima last
  * What to plot: Selected cells in table (recommend to select cells with similar length)
  * Sort by: Cell length
  * Colormap: Gray
  * Subtract background: unchecked
  * Intensity Normalization: **checked**
  * Highlight Maxima: unchecked
  * Show full cell width: **checked**
  
  # How to run this code
  
* Use Fiji ImageJ, v1.53, https://fiji.sc/
* Open the demograph image file generated by BacStalk
* Run Generate_ROIs and save ROI file
  * This should "segment" the cells in the demograph image from BacStalk
  * Each ROI should correspond to one cell
* Run AverageIntensityMap
  * Make sure to modify all directories according to your system
