# Content
ImageJ, Matlab and Python code used in the study "Two antagonistic response regulators control <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> polarization during mechanotaxis".  Please refer to the corresponding paragraphs of the Methods section for more details. 

* **average_maps** - Create qualitative average localization maps of fluorescent proteins from cells segmented by BacStalk.
* **cAMP_PaQa_PlacP1** - Plot PaQa or PlacP1 ratios to measure cAMP levels of individual cells from cells segmented by BacStalk or measured by flow cytometry, respectively. 
* **dynamic_localization_twitching** - Plot pole-to-pole movement rates of fluorescent proteins (dynamic localization) and single cell twitching behaviour (twitching) from cells segmented by BacStalk.
* **static_localization** - Plot quantitative average localization graphs (localization profiles, polar localization index, symmetry index, whole-cell fluorescence) of fluorescent proteins from cells segmented by BacStalk.
